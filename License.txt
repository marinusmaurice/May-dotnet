I place no restrictions on the use of code in this repostory, including:
- The 'May' option type and related utility methods in the 'May' project
- The examples and related code in the example project
- The tests and related code in the testing project

That means:
- Attribution not required.
- Commercial use allowed.
- Derivative use allowed.

But note:
- No guarantees (I did my best to ensure correctness, but I am not infallible.).

Not that I wouldn't mind hearing about it if you used my code.
If you need a 'real' license for obtuse legal reasons, I would be happy to grant it.
